Day 1:
- i started this

Day 2:
- just kept building the gui, free of errors
- i started debugging some blocks which led me to inhumane fking errors which i have never encountered. But eventually, i found my breakthrough. 
- some notable error was some GUI errors (label area not showing, labels appearing horizontally). But the only problem that fixed that was the vb1 (sub-vbmain) was set to HBox instead of VBox.

Day 3:
- i started late, 4 hours of firewatch good tho. It helped me fixing the error that kept occuring.
- and only then i realized that i wasn't placing some of my functions to methods. I just singlehandedly made them be with the main code block. 
- i also discovered i was stupid, cuz i created too much for branches and too many arraylist (i made them initially to server as a reference for main_server).
- need to keep in mind how some prior logic works not only have keen knowledge, but to put up to use. Just like how i didn't think of creating an update typa method for the label area.
- but happy to see that the stupidity made me hit 2 birds w 1 stone, cuz i made their indexes/id change (whenever they are deleted) which is caused by the "update" method. SEE HOW USEFUL THAT THING WAS.
- ALSO I JUST FOUND OUT THAT YOU CAN CREATE A METHOD INSIDE A METHOD. USING CLASS "Runnable". Idk if this is just limited to JavaFX.
- FINALLY METHOD WORKS TOO, IDK WHY IS THIS GOING SO SMOOTH.
- and for the last, sort by date works. I had to find some help on reddit and quora, i used some code suggestion of a responder, so im currently clueless on how the block sort by date functions.
